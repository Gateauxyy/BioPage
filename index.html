            <p>The spectrum of mental illnesses is extensive and includes, but is not limited to, depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These conditions may arise from complex interactions of factors such as genetics, physiology, environment, and psychosocial elements.Mental illnesses are not solely individual concerns; they are significant societal issues. While awareness of mental health problems is growing, there still exists a considerable amount of misunderstanding and social stigma, potentially leading to social isolation and discrimination against those with mental illnesses.</p>
            <p>Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) is a novel neurostimulation technique characterized by its non-invasive and focal nature. Research indicates that TUS has the potential to inhibit the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Compared to other neuroregulation techniques, TUS possesses significant advantages such as greater depth of stimulation (reaching deep brain nuclei), high spatial resolution (on the order of millimeters), and excellent electromagnetic compatibility. These attributes endow TUS with substantial clinical potential.</p>
            <p>From non-invasive neuromodulation to potential therapeutic applications in neurological disorders, This program promises to be an enlightening experience for scientists from diverse disciplines. Together, let's delve into the realm of TUS, paving the way for a future where science and healing converge. Jump in now for a brief introduction on the basic concept of TUS and even gets a chance to use the TUS device!</p>
